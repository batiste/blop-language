# The blop language

<img src="/img/blop.png" width="120">

Blop is a turing complete language that natively and elegantly generates Virtual DOM using a familiar HTML like syntax. Unlike JSX you are not limited to expressions and can use the full power of the language to generate Virtual DOM.
You can mix any statement, expressions, and HTML like syntax within the same function.

The HTML tags written with blop are converted into Virtual DOM nodes using the [snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom/) library.

The Blop language compiles to ES6 compliant JavaScript. The language is mostly self contained and has very few dependencies.

## Language features

  * Virtual DOM generation is natively supported by the language.
  * Fast compilation (+30'000 lines by second).
  * A linter is integrated into the language: no linter debate.
  * Good integration with Visual Studio Code: linter and syntactic coloration.
  * Source maps.
  * Server Side Rendering in the example.
  * Hot module reloading in the example (HMR)
  * Type annotation with very basic type inference warnings.
  * Similar syntax and features than ES6.

## Language features missing

  * The language is still in beta
